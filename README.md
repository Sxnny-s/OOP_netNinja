# JavaScript Classes, Constructors, and Objects - Follow-Along

This repository contains the code I followed along with from a YouTube tutorial by The Net Ninja. The tutorial covers key JavaScript concepts such as classes, constructors, and objects. The goal of this project was to understand how to define and instantiate classes, initialize objects with constructors, and work with object properties and methods.

## Tutorial Overview

The tutorial provided by The Net Ninja explains the following concepts:
- **Classes**: A blueprint for creating objects that share common properties and methods.
- **Constructors**: Special functions within a class used to initialize objects with default or custom values.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes that contain data and methods for interacting with that data.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **Creating Classes**: Classes are used to define a structure for objects that share common behavior and properties.
- **Constructor Functions**: Constructor functions allow us to initialize objects with specific values when an instance of a class is created.
- **Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that can operate on the data contained within the objects.

## Example Code

Here's a simple example of a class with a constructor and methods, which was explained in the tutorial:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, job) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.job = job;
  }

  introduce() {
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name}. I am ${this.age} years old and I work as a ${this.job}.`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Person class
let person1 = new Person('Alice', 30, 'Engineer');

// Calling a method
person1.introduce();  // Output: Hi, my name is Alice. I am 30 years old and I work as a Engineer.
